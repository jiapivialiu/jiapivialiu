## üéì About Me

I am a final-year PhD Candidate in Statistics at The University of British Columbia. My research focuses on **Computational Statistics**, **Machine Learning Algorithm**, **Time Series Analysis**, which allows me to design convex optimization models on sequential time series (and beyond), develop scalable machine learning algorithms, and solve real-life problems with guaranteed numeric accuracy and high-performance computing. 

My academic experience as a **PhD Researcher** and **Senior Academic and Teaching Assistant** coupled with my industrial experience as a **Risk Modeling Analyst** at Royal Bank of Canada, **Statistical Consultant** at applied statistics and data analysi group (UBC), **Student Machine Learning Researcher** at Statistics Canada, and a **Data Analyst Intern** at BOSCH have equipped me with extensive experience of collaborating with multi-functional teams including senior researchers, statisticians, data scientists, engineers, business partners, and healthcare professionals. 

Over 1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ years of experience working on various data-related problems has equipped me with a rigorous understanding of statistical principles, machine learning methodologies, real-life applications on various fields, and efficient computation and reproducible and reliable implementation through software development. 
<!-- I am passionate about leveraging innovative machine learning algorithms to redefine and modify gaming experience using scientific computing language and modern machine learning libraries. I am proficient in sharing results through presentations, papers, and interactive demonstrations. --> 

**I am passionate about leveraging reliable data-driven methods to drive business impact. I aspire to build my career at the intersection of product data science, machine learning, and business strategy. I thrive in collaborative, cross-functional environments and enjoy solving complex business challenges through analytical insights.**

Beyond the world of data, I enjoy staying active through lifting weights and cardios, fostering community by organizing graduate student seminars, and exploring various other interests in my daily life. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!

## üíº Experience & Projects

This section will showcase some of my projects and professional experiences. Feel free to explore my repositories! Links provided below.

### Upcoming Internship
* Retail Risk Modeling Analyst at Royal Bank of Canada (2025)
  * Coming soon.üé•

### Recent Collaborative Research

* Project: **Algorithm Development** for Accurate Ill-Conditioned Linear System Solver. (2023 - 2025)
  * Derived a modified Kalman filter algorithm in math to solver linear system based on divided difference/discrete derivatives.
  * Coded the algorithm from scratch, 0% -- üíØ%. Implementation in C++ is available in [glmgen/trendfilter](https://github.com/glmgen/trendfilter).
  * Finished draft manuscript writing.
  * Tested in simulation showing **better numeric accuracy** on solving the ill-conditioned linear system compared to existing solvers and staying correct when competitors fail.
  * Collaborators: @dajmcdon et al.
 
* Project: **Methodology Development** for Time Series Trend Filtering. (2022 - 2024)
  * *Publication on PLoS Computational Biology, August 2024*: [*rtestim*: Time-Varying Reproduction Number Estimation with Trend Filtering](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012324)
  * ‚úçÔ∏èFinished the paper writing and revision. 
  * üñ•Ô∏èCoded the machine learning algorithm (proximal Newton, ADMM, and dynamic programming) in C++ from scratch.
  * An R package wrapper is availble in [rtestim](https://dajmcdon.github.io/rtestim/) for scalable computation! üéâ
  * Validated to be more accurate than competitors in synthetic data experiments.
  * Applied the method in Covid-19 transmissibility filtering with adaptive changepoint detection.
  * Collaborators: @dajmcdon, @zcaiElvis, PG.
 
* Side Project: **LLM Fine-Tuning** for AI-Generated Text Detection. (2024)
  * Open-Source HuggingFace Model [*e5-small-lora*](https://huggingface.co/MayZhou/e5-small-lora-ai-generated-detector}{e5-small-lora}).
  * Ranked TOP1Ô∏è‚É£ on [RAID](https://raid-bench.xyz/leaderboard) benchmark leaderboard.
  * Collaborators: @menglinzhou, BZ.

* Internship Project: **Machine Learning** in Multi-Source Record Linkage. (2019)
  * Applied various classification methods and optimized using nested cross validation.
  * Improved record matching accuracy from the logistic regression baseline of 84% to 99.5%, effectively handling over 100,000 records with 10+ matching features and 30% missing data.
  * Collaborators: Methodology Department, Statistics Canada.

### Ongoing Indie Projects

* Side Project: **Fincial LLM** on Financial textual data analysis
  * Main tasks: semantic analysis, sentiment understanding, time sereis forecasting, and more.
  * Open-source resources [*fintext-forecasting*](https://github.com/jiapivialiu/fintext-forecasting) under active development.

* Side Project: Statflix & Chill: [*statflix-n-chill*](https://github.com/jiapivialiu/statflix-n-chill)
  * A list of useful things that require low efforts for statistical researchers to do while in low energyü™´.
  * Welcome collaborators!üëã
