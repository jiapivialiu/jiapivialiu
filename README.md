## üéì About Me

I am a fifth-year PhD Candidate in Statistics at The University of British Columbia. 

My academic experience as a **PhD researcher** and a **Statistical Consultant** at an Applied Statistics and Data Science consulting group, coupled with my industrial experience as a **Student Machine Learning Researcher** at Statistics Canada, and a **Data Analyst** at BOSCH have equipped me with extensive experience of collaborating with multi-functional teams including senior statisticians and data scientists, engineers, and business partners. 

Over 10 years of experience working on various statistical problems has equipped me with a rigorous understanding of statistical principles, methodologies, real-life applications on various fields, and efficient computation and reproducible and reliable implementation through software development. 
<!-- I am passionate about leveraging innovative machine learning algorithms to redefine and modify gaming experience using scientific computing language and modern machine learning libraries. I am proficient in sharing results through presentations, papers, and interactive demonstrations. --> 

Beyond the world of data, I enjoy staying active through lifting weights and cardios, fostering community by organizing graduate student seminars, and exploring various other interests in my daily life. I used to be a member in a debate team and a dance team.
